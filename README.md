# üéÆ  Spotify Arcade

Spotify Arcade is a full-stack web application that features interactive mini-games based on real-time Spotify data. Users authenticate with their Spotify accounts via OAuth2 and then play music-themed games where their choices are driven by dynamic Spotify artist and track data.

The purpose of the project was to learn and demonstrate API integration, user session management, data modeling, and scalable deployment. The application was developed using a structured development process inspired by the Unified Process and Scrum.
