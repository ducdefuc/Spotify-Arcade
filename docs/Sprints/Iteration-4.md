**Sprint backlog 4**

Last week: Worked on the higher or lower game, it was tricky to learn how to use the spotify web API and get it to conform to my application. The strategy to get artists was not as straightforward as i'd wish it to be, so a improvisation strategy had to be done. Rate Limits using the API also proved to be a problem

This week try to study some more for oral exam. Finish higher or lower ( refactoring and finishing touches ) and update the user experience/visuals, implement point system.
