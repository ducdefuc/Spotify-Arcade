##### Spring backlog 8

Last week: Deployment of application is successful, some bugs occured such as displaying content after artists having no images in higher or lower, a typo was the cause. This is however fixed. The spotify Web playback SDK also did not initiate in time when the page was rendered. This is also fixed. Also finished test cases for each issue.

This week, focus on finalizing all documentation. Make sure application is working properly on deployed version to deliver. Hand in the project.
