##### Sprint backlog 7

Last week: Implementation of guess the song game mode went good, was fast since it was easier to implement by already having the groundwork for higher or lower to lean on. Tests also went faster to implement. Only reached the rate limit once.

This week, try to deploy the application on the web. Complete tests for remaining issues that are missing and finalize testspecification.
